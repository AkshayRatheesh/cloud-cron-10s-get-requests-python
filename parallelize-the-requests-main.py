This is a Python script that creates a cloud function that runs every 10 seconds and sends HTTP requests to a list of URLs. It uses the functions framework library to define the cloud function entry point and the requests library to send the requests. It also uses the multiprocessing library to parallelize the requests and print the status code and the URL for each request. The cloud function returns the output as a JSON string.
